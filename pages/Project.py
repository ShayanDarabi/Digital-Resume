‚úîÔ∏è Solving a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP):
- Navigating a complex challenge, I delved into the intricacies of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). With 41 workers and a fleet of 17 vehicles at hand, I harnessed the power of [Google OR-Tools]({google_or}) to optimize routes while adhering to capacity constraints.

- Every distance and time matrix was meticulously calculated, forming a sturdy foundation for the optimization journey. Careful allocation of vehicles, considering capacities, ensured smooth operations.

- As the optimal solution emerged, I visualized each vehicle's route using [Folium]({folium}) and the [Open Route Source API]({open_route_api}). This tangible representation brought logistical efficiency to life on the map, translating intricate plans into actionable reality.

- In essence, my expertise fused mathematics, data analysis, and visualization to conquer the CVRP, exemplifying a dedication to practical solutions for complex real-world puzzles.

‚úîÔ∏è Several Projects About Data Aggregation, Cleaning, and Visualization
- I excel at refining and combining intricate datasets using Pandas and Numpy, ensuring data integrity. Leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn, I craft enlightening visuals, including P control charts. I create informative dashboards, and with Pandas Profiling, I extract actionable insights from exploratory data analysis. My focus is on turning complexity into clarity.

‚úîÔ∏è Process Mining:
- Using the dataset at my disposal, I took a close look at a company's operations using a helpful tool called [pm4py]({pm4py}), a popular library in Python for process mining. After getting the data in shape, I let pm4py work its magic. It revealed how things flowed, pinpointed bottlenecks, and made sure the actual processes matched the plan.
